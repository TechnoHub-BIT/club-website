Just run the following command at the root of your project and answer questions:

```sh
npx readme-md-generator
```

Or use default values for all questions (`-y`):

```sh
npx readme-md-generator -y
```

Use your own `ejs` README template (`-p`):

```
npx readme-md-generator -p path/to/my/own/template.md
```
